# Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide - Udemy course

This repository contains my solution to the lessons on the [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide) from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) using [hardhat](https://hardhat.org).

It contains both smart contract and FE implementation for the Lottery contract. But for the Campaign, only the smart contract.

For the campaign FE I decided to try [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) in a separate repo. It's not done yet and I'm not sure I'll actually finish it honestly.

NOTE: This is not a guide, for that you should follow the course. I decided to make this public in case anyone took on the challenge of doing the course in hardhat and might need some help.

# Basic commands

```shell
# Help
npx hardhat help

# Test
npx hardhat test

# Deploy contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
